# U.S. Hospital Readmission & Care Quality Dashboard

Built with Power BI | Dataset: CMS Hospital Readmissions

---

 Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key care quality metrics — including **hospital readmission rates** and **average length of stay** — across U.S. hospitals. The dashboard allows filtering by state and condition to support decision-making in population health, care coordination, and health policy analysis.
